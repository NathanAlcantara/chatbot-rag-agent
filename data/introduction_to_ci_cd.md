# Introduction to CI/CD

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) are essential practices in modern software development. They aim to streamline the software development lifecycle by automating the integration and deployment processes.

## What is Continuous Integration (CI)?
Continuous Integration is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. The primary goals of CI are:
- Detect integration errors early.
- Maintain a healthy and stable codebase.

## What is Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)?
- **Continuous Delivery**: Automates the release of the codebase so it can be deployed to production at any time.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Extends Continuous Delivery by automatically deploying changes to production without manual intervention.

### Benefits of CI/CD
- Faster feedback loops.
- Improved code quality.
- Reduced deployment risks.
- Increased development velocity.

Start by integrating CI/CD into your development workflow to achieve these benefits!
