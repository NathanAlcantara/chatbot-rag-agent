# Securing CI/CD Pipelines

Security is a critical aspect of CI/CD pipelines. Implementing security best practices reduces vulnerabilities and ensures safe deployments.

## Common Vulnerabilities
- Exposed credentials and secrets.
- Insufficient access controls.
- Insecure dependencies.

## Best Practices
- Use secret management tools (e.g., Vault).
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
- Scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Example Security Check

Here's a sample workflow for scanning dependencies:

```yaml
name: Dependency Scan

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run security scan
        run: npm audit
```

Prioritize security in your CI/CD pipelines to protect your applications.
